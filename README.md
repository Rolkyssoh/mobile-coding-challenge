# mobile-coding-challenge
This small mobile application designed by me allows you to list the github repositories that have been created in the last 30 days. To set it up, I used the React-native frameword for the front-end and the firebase for authentication. I opted for React-native; not only because it is the mobile framework that I currently master but also because with it I manage to create professional mobile applications. Regarding firebase I used it in this project because I needed a fast and reliable solution for user authentication.
For its execution we have two choices; either on an android emulator, or on a physical android phone connected by cable to the pc.For the physical telephone, it is necessary in advance to activate the *"Debugging"* mode in the Developer option of the telephone. For the emulator you just need to have Android-studio installed on your machine and in android-studio have an emulator configured ... In both cases the process is the same: we open the project in two different terminals and in the first one we type *"yarn or npm start"*, we wait for it to execute and then we type *"npx react-native run-android"*... if we are on a physical phone a message will be displayed on the screen and we will have to validate. But if you are on an emulator, this is done automatically and the application is displayed and is ready to use.
